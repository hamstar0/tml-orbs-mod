	-	@Tips
		-	Other Orbs: "<Dryad Name> doesn't know what sort of power she carries. If only she wasn't so pressed to
			have to settle with mere capitalism. I don't know where she gets those orbs she's selling, but they can
			sure open up a world of possibilities to whoever knows how to use them. <Guide Name> might know more."
		-	Red & Green Orbs: "Though <Dryad Name> gives warnings about using the <Staff of Gaia>, more practically
			I think some things of value might be lost from those it's used upon. Conversely, I hear it also gives
			back a portion of what it takes, in a different form."
		-	Pink Orb: "Ever encounter that annoying Trickster fellow? I hear it likes to reward those who think they
			can outwit them extra quickly. If you ask me, I think it's up to something..."
